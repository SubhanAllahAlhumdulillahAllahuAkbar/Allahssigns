            <h2>Ayat</h2>
            <p><strong>Posted on:</strong> November 23, 2024</p>
            <p>What does the word ayat/verse mean? According to the Northeast Islamic Community Center, the word Ayat literally means “clear proof,” “sign,” “evidence,” “warning,” “extraordinary event or people.” The Qur'an aka the pure word of Allah, is composed of at least 6,348 ayahs, verses, or signs from Allah; this is including the word "Bismillah."" Although the word Ayat literally means sign or clear proof, the word Ayat in Arabic has generally been defined as one or more sentences having a clear beginning and a clear end, each constituting part of a Qur'anic chapter. However, we know that Allah has no beginning or end and is not confined to time and space as we are and, thus, the word of Allah in a similar fashion will showcase this divinity of God in that it and it's signs can never be exhausted, negated, or depleted no matter how much we try to exhaust, negate, or deplete them, and we thus have an endless bounty of knowledge which we can learn from, derive meaning from, gain value from, and can and will certainly return to Him before exhausting Him or His word even in the least bit. InshaAllah (i.e. God-willing), on this blog, we delve deeper into Allah's signs looking deeply at Allah’s Ayats as they are composed today to see if we can derive new meaning/understanding of them, covering as many topics as we can big and small, according to the existing Qur'an as it was orally revealed to the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon him by way of Allah's messenger angel Gabriel. If you find this kind of content interesting, please bookmark this tab on your computer, laptop, or phone and check it every day or every other day to see if more info/information has been revealed. 


                I look forward to embarking on this journey with you, and I look forward to reaching new heights, inshaAllah (aka Allah-willing aka so please Allah), with our study of the Qur’an aka the pure word of Allah! </p> </div>
